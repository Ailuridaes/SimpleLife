Simple Life
===========
Yet another Android application to track life totals in Magic: the Gathering games, Simple Life was created with the primary goal of presenting life totals in a clean and simple design free of clutter, while providing an intuitive, easy to use interface to change them or inspect previous changes.  Currently, the app is optimized for one on one scenarios, so there is currently no support for more than 2 players.  

Usage
-----
The primary screen of Simple Life is the life counter that greets you when you first open the app.  In order to increase or decrease a life total, simply tap the top or bottom half of that life total.

A swipe to the left or right will reveal the life histories for both players and the modifications that have been made.  This can be extremely useful for double checking your math and to verify life totals with your opponent.

Simply tap the settings button in the middle of the life histories menu to bring you to the settings, which contains the reset button, ability to change the reset value, a dice roller, and other options:
